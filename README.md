# ðŸ•¹ Sonny's TF2 config

My personal `Team Fortress 2` configuration. Initially I wrote this config 9 years ago, when I played the game competitively. Then it was mostly based on performance & gameplay improvements. I've decided to rewerite the config for `2023`, but this time focusing only gameplay improvements. Most of the features, part of this config, I've used in `6v6` & `9v9` competitive environments. I also find them useful for casual play as well. Do not expect any significant performance gains
from this config. You can include your own graphical configurations and extend this config.

## ðŸ”§ Installation

Download the master ZIP file or copy RAW text of your desired config and drag and drop your .cfg file in:
"Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\my_custom_files\cfg\autoexec.cfg"
Remember to rename your desired config to autoexec.cfg. Do not paste eg:autoexec_CORE.cfg

Optional: Make sure to make this file READ-ONLY to prevent any changes in the settings of this config.

Paste surfaceproperties.txt in /custom/my_custom_files/scripts.

If you have any other configs created with clugu or some other config generator it is recommended that you download the CORE
version because some of the features may not be working correctly.

## ðŸ›© Launch options

If you want the most of your machine use -dxlevel 81 otherwise use 95.

-novid -console -w XXXX -h XXXX -dxlevel XX
  
  > It is recommended that you remove dxlevel after the first start. It is known to cause crashes on some systems.

Where XXXX insert a resolution 1x/2x/3x lower than your native one, it helps performance a lot.

These are the launch options that I have the most success with. Feel free to add your own or refer to the config itself for more options.
