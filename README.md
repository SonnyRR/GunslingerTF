Sonny's TF2 config
===========
Hello, I have been slowly working on a private config for my needs in the last 10 months or so since no config could suit my needs and did not made a 
huge improvement on the stability of the game. I have reached a point that I feel the config is close to completion 
and maybe of use of some players. The config is written to take the most advantage out of my PC with a moderate graphical sacrifice, it
consists of multiple layers and a great deal of features. It may be unstable on some machines and I can't guarantee that you are not going to get crashes 
and stability issues. The config is based around in-game customizability and gaining advantage over the enemy.

Here are some of the features:

- Custom server admin mode (Up to as many servers as you wish; list of configs and maps changable on the moment with a simple command such as: blands instead of 2x rcon changelevel cp_badlands / ecp6 instead of !rcon exec etf2l_6v6_5cp; open it for how to use it and more features).
- In-game memory compactor (Frees up memory; it frees up memory everytime when you move if there is memory to be cleared.)
- Chat & Voice toggle (ON/OFF)
- Loadout switcher (Hold ALT+6-9 to switch through the 4 default loadout slots + a hidden 5th one.)
- 3 different network presets (Chris BAD&GOOD; m0re's and my personal network settings that can be used straight in-game by typing a simple alias in the console.)
- Netgraph presets.
- Built in respawn timer. (Very useful in competitive to keep track of medic respawns etc; it shows everytime you hit TAB)
- Instant FIX button. (Restarts sound, hud; heartbeat and records a temp demo.)
- Null-movement.
- Wait Tester (F11).
- Sourcemod plugin lister (cmd:listplugins)
- Custom Viewmodel FOV switcher (Hold MOUSE4 and move the scroll up or down in order to increase/decrease VMFOV; very smooth, useful on the go)
- Security settings (Inspired by Rhapsody's TF2 Config)


Custom Binds:

- "F2" = Reloads the config.
- "/" = Toggles your viewmodels on/off. 
- "F11" = Checks if wait is enabled on the server.
- Holding down "F1" = All in one fix it button.
- Holding down "Mouse4" and moving the scroll wheel up and down = Viewmodel FOV switcher.
- "END" = Suicide.
- "Pause" = Pauses the game(Does not work on all keyboards).
- "1-9" = Switches classes on the numpad.
- "Keypad ENTER" = 1st Press: Turns OFF Text Chat. 2nd Press: Turns OFF Voice Chat. 3rd Press: Toggles ON Text And Voice Chat.
- Hold "ALT+6-9" to switch through the 4 default loadout slots + a hidden 5th one.

Startup time may be slow so don't worry the game is preloading its necessary files. 
I am looking for general feedback and hopefully, if there is enough interest I will be making more changes and improvements.

Here is a benchmark:
CPU: Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 overclocked  to 2.80 GHz; standart 2 fan cooling
GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTS250 DK Edition 1 GB DDR3 
RAM: 2x2 A-Data (Unknown MhZ)
HDD: Recycled 500 GB Hitachi drive
OS: Win 7 Ultimate x64

2639 frames 38.561 seconds 78.44 fps (14.61 ms/f) 2.761 fps variability.
Using meb's benchmark 1 demo with 341.44 Nvidia drivers; lo: -novid -console  -w 1280 -h 1024.

I get constant 150 fps in competitive servers almost everywhere with small drops on some middles (~138-144 fps), but the game doesn't choke on itself.
In valve pubs I get around ~120-150 fps with no serious drops.
