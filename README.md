# üïπ Sonny's TF2 config

My personal `Team Fortress 2` configuration. I wrote this config between 2012 - 2015, when I played the game competitively at the [European TF2 League](https://etf2l.org). The config is primarily intended for competitive play and I've used in `6v6` & `9v9` competitive tournaments. The majority of features are also useful for casual play. Do **not** expect any significant performance gains from this config, although it contains some optimizations. You can include your own graphical configurations and extend it.

> üöß This config doesn't support the new x64 bit TF2 client. It was developed, tested and used with the old x32 bit one **more than 10 years ago**.

## üîß Installation

1. Download the master `ZIP` file or clone the repository.
2. Copy the contents of the artifact in the following directory: `\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom\my_custom_files\cfg\`
3. üí° **Optional:** Make the files & directories READ-ONLY to prevent any changes in the settings of this config.
4. Paste surfaceproperties.txt in `\custom\my_custom_files\scripts`.

‚ùó If you have any other configs created with `clugu` or some other config generator it is recommended that you remove all `*.cfg` files and reset all `cvars` via `steam://runsafe/440`

## üõ© Launch options

`-novid -high -console -w XXXX -h XXXX -dxlevel XX`

üí° If you want the most of your machine use `-dxlevel 81` otherwise use `-dxlevel 95`.

üí≠Where `XXXX` insert a resolution 1x/2x/3x lower than your native one, it can help performance.
