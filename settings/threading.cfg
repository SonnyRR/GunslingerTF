                  // defines the threading method to be used by the material
                  // system. It has been unstable to use in the past, but

                  // As an aside, there are quite a few bugs in the demo system
                  // that occur when mat_queue_mode is set to a value that is
                  // not '-1'. If you intend to do work with the demo system,
                  // maybe you should change this.
